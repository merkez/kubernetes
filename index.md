# [Purpose](#purpose){: .btn .btn-green .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 }

The aim of this website to collect all possible handy information and resources in one place and if possible include your own drawings related to Kubernetes. Here is the list of resources which are taken into consideration. 


# [Courses](#courses){: .btn .btn-blue .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 }

This section contains list of courses which is free to distribute its content. 

- [Introduction To Kubernetes](docs/introduction-to-kubernetes-edx)
   
   This is a course which is free on [edX platform](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-kubernetes), however since it is not possible to see all content in one page, it is difficult to navigate through pages, that's why I have collected presented information on that course while I was studying on it.
