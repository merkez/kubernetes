A 1000-ton boulder, on the other hand, is not easy to carry at all. This boulder represents the monolith application - sedimented layers of features and redundant logic translated into thousands of lines of code, written in a single, not so modern programming language, based on outdated software architecture patterns and principles.</p><p>In time, the new features and improvements added to code complexity, making development more challenging - loading, compiling, and building times increase with every new update. However, there is some ease in administration as the application is running on a single server, ideally a Virtual Machine or a Mainframe.</p><p>A monolith has a rather expensive taste in hardware. Being a large, single piece of software which continuously grows, it has to run on a single system which has to satisfy its compute, memory, storage, and networking requirements. The hardware of such capacity is both complex and pricey.</p><p>Since the entire monolith application runs as a single process, the scaling of individual features of the monolith is almost impossible. It internally supports a hardcoded number of connections and operations. However, scaling the entire application means to manually deploy a new instance of the monolith on another server, typically behind a load balancing appliance - another pricey solution.</p><p>During upgrades, patches or migrations of the monolith application - downtimes occur and maintenance windows have to be planned as disruptions in service are expected to impact clients. While there are solutions to minimize downtimes to customers by setting up monolith applications in a highly available active/passive configuration, it may still be challenging for system engineers to keep all systems at the same patch level.</p><h2 id="the-modern-service"> <a href="#the-modern-service" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> The Modern Service</h2><p><strong>Microservices</strong> can be deployed individually on separate servers provisioned with fewer resources - only what is required by each service and the host system itself.</p><p>Microservices-based architecture is aligned with Event-driven Architecture and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) principles, where complex applications are composed of small independent processes which communicate with each other through APIs over a network. APIs allow access by other internal services of the same application or external, third-party services and applications.</p><p>Although the distributed nature of microservices adds complexity to the architecture, one of the greatest benefits of microservices is scalability. With the overall application becoming modular, each microservice can be scaled individually, either manually or automated through demand-based autoscaling.</p><p>Seamless upgrades and patching processes are other benefits of microservices architecture. There is virtually no downtime and no service disruption to clients because upgrades are rolled out seamlessly - one service at a time, rather than having to re-compile, re-build and re-start an entire monolithic application. As a result, businesses are able to develop and roll-out new features and updates a lot faster, in an agile approach, having separate teams focusing on separate features, thus being more productive and cost-effective.</p><h2 id="refactoring"> <a href="#refactoring" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Refactoring</h2><p>A so-called “Big-bang” approach focuses all efforts with the refactoring of the monolith, postponing the development and implementation of any new features - essentially delaying progress and possibly, in the process, even breaking the core of the business, the monolith.</p><p>An incremental refactoring approach guarantees that new features are developed and implemented as modern microservices which are able to communicate with the monolith through APIs, without appending to the monolith’s code. In the meantime, features are refactored out of the monolith which slowly fades away while all, or most its functionality is modernized into microservices. This incremental approach offers a gradual transition from a legacy monolith to modern microservices architecture and allows for phased migration of application features into the cloud.</p><p>The refactoring phase slowly transforms the monolith into a cloud-native application which takes full advantage of cloud features, by coding in new programming languages and applying modern architectural patterns. Through refactoring, a legacy monolith application receives a second chance at life - to live on as a modular system adapted to fully integrate with today’s fast-paced cloud automation tools and services.</p><h2 id="challenges"> <a href="#challenges" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Challenges</h2><p>When considering a legacy Mainframe based system, written in older programming languages - Cobol or Assembler, it may be more economical to just re-build it from the ground up as a cloud-native application. A poorly designed legacy application should be re-designed and re-built from scratch following modern architectural patterns for microservices and even containers. Applications tightly coupled with data stores are also poor candidates for refactoring.</p><p>Choosing runtimes may be another challenge. If deploying many modules on a single physical or virtual server, chances are that different libraries and runtime environment may conflict with one another causing errors and failures. This forces deployments of single modules per servers in order to separate their dependencies - not an economical way of resource management, and no real segregation of libraries and runtimes, as each server also has an underlying Operating System running with its libraries, thus consuming server resources - at times the OS consuming more resources than the application module itself.</p><h2 id="success-stories"> <a href="#success-stories" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Success Stories</h2><p>Although a challenging process, moving from monoliths to microservices is a rewarding journey especially once a business starts to see growth and success delivered by a refactored application system. Below we are listing only a handful of the success stories of companies which rose to the challenge to modernize their monolith business applications.
