This repository consists of variety of resources combined under one point, all content and examples are examined. Although it does not include many resources at the moment (11.07.2020), it will be expanded in time while learning process continuing. 

The main logic is inspired by [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) lists however instead of providing pure README file with bunch of links, cool-kubernetes approach is a little bit different. All content of this repository and the main website [https://mrturkmen.com/kubernetes](https://mrturkmen.com/kubernetes) will be updated whenever new things happen. 


The content of website is available under `gh-pages` branch, which means web content contribution should be committed from `gh-pages` branch. Instead, adding example, explanation or sample library implementation will be placed in master branch. 


If you would like to contribute and being part of this journey, you are very welcome to [create issue](https://github.com/mrturkmencom/kubernetes/issues/new) or [pull request](https://github.com/mrturkmencom/kubernetes/compare). The contribution could be typo fix, resource addition with brief explanation or anything else which is suitable for this repository.
